        <p class="speech">Well, sir, what are you doing here?  Wasting your time as usual, I suppose?</p>

        <h5 class="name charGoring">LORD GORING.</h5>  
        <p class="speech"><span class="stage-direction">[_Throws down paper and rises_.]</span>  My dear father, when one
        pays a visit it is for the purpose of wasting other people’s time, not one’s own.</p>

        <h5 class="name charCaversham">LORD CAVERSHAM.</h5>  
        <p class="speech">Have you been thinking over what I spoke to you about last night?</p>

        <h5 class="name charGoring">LORD GORING.</h5>  
        <p class="speech">I have been thinking about nothing else.</p>

        <h5 class="name charCaversham">LORD CAVERSHAM.</h5>  
        <p class="speech">Engaged to be married yet?</p>

        <h5 class="name charGoring">LORD GORING.</h5>  
        <p class="speech"><span class="stage-direction">[_Genially_.]</span>  Not yet: but I hope to be before lunch-time.</p>

        <h5 class="name charCaversham">LORD CAVERSHAM.</h5>  
        <p class="speech"><span class="stage-direction">[_Caustically_.]</span>  You can have till dinner-time if it
        would be of any convenience to you.</p>

        <h5 class="name charGoring">LORD GORING.</h5>  
        <p class="speech">Thanks awfully, but I think I’d sooner be engaged before lunch.</p>

        <h5 class="name charCaversham">LORD CAVERSHAM.</h5>  
        <p class="speech">Humph!  Never know when you are serious or not.</p>

        <h5 class="name charGoring">LORD GORING.</h5>  
        <p class="speech">Neither do I, father.</p>
