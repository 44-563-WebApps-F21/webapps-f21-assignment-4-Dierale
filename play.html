            <h5 class="name charCaversham">LORD CAVERSHAM.</h5>  Well, sir, what are you doing here?  Wasting your time
            as usual, I suppose?</p>

        <p class="speech">
            <h5 class="name charGoring">LORD GORING.</h5>  <span class="stage-direction">[_Throws down paper and rises_.]</span>  My dear father, when one
            pays a visit it is for the purpose of wasting other people’s time, not
            one’s own.</p>

        <p class="speech">
            <h5 class="name charCaversham">LORD CAVERSHAM.</h5>  Have you been thinking over what I spoke to you about
            last night?</p>

        <p class="speech">
            <h5 class="name charGoring">LORD GORING.</h5>  I have been thinking about nothing else.</p>

        <p class="speech">
            <h5 class="name charCaversham">LORD CAVERSHAM.</h5>  Engaged to be married yet?</p>

        <p class="speech">
            <h5 class="name charGoring">LORD GORING.</h5>  <span class="stage-direction">[_Genially_.]</span>  Not yet: but I hope to be before lunch-time.
        </p>

        <p class="speech">
            <h5 class="name charCaversham">LORD CAVERSHAM.</h5>  <span class="stage-direction">[_Caustically_.]</span>  You can have till dinner-time if it
            would be of any convenience to you.</p>

        <p class="speech">
            <h5 class="name charGoring">LORD GORING.</h5>  Thanks awfully, but I think I’d sooner be engaged before
            lunch.</p>

        <p class="speech">
            <h5 class="name charCaversham">LORD CAVERSHAM.</h5>  Humph!  Never know when you are serious or not.
        </p>

        <p class="speech">
            <h5 class="name charGoring">LORD GORING.</h5>  Neither do I, father.
