        <p>[_Enter_ LORD CAVERSHAM.]</p>

        <p>LORD CAVERSHAM.  Well, sir, what are you doing here?  Wasting your time
            as usual, I suppose?</p>

        <p>LORD GORING.  [_Throws down paper and rises_.]  My dear father, when one
            pays a visit it is for the purpose of wasting other people’s time, not
            one’s own.</p>

        <p>LORD CAVERSHAM.  Have you been thinking over what I spoke to you about
            last night?</p>

        <p>LORD GORING.  I have been thinking about nothing else.</p>

        <p>LORD CAVERSHAM.  Engaged to be married yet?</p>

        <p>LORD GORING.  [_Genially_.]  Not yet: but I hope to be before lunch-time.
        </p>

        <p>LORD CAVERSHAM.  [_Caustically_.]  You can have till dinner-time if it
            would be of any convenience to you.</p>

        <p>LORD GORING.  Thanks awfully, but I think I’d sooner be engaged before
            lunch.</p>

        <p>LORD CAVERSHAM.  Humph!  Never know when you are serious or not.
        </p>

        <p>LORD GORING.  Neither do I, father.
        </p>
