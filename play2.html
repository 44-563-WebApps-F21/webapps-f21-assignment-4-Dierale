        <h5 class="name charCaversham">LORD CAVERSHAM.</h5>  
        <p class="speech">I suppose you have read _The Times_ this morning?</p>

        <h5 class="name charGoring">LORD GORING.</h5>  
        <p class="speech"><span class="stage-direction">[_Airily_.]</span>  The Times?  Certainly not.  
            I only read _The Morning Post_.  All that one should know about modern life is where the 
            Duchesses are; anything else is quite demoralising.</p>

        <h5 class="name charCaversham">LORD CAVERSHAM.</h5>  
        <p class="speech">Do you mean to say you have not read _The Times_ leading
            article on Robert Chiltern’s career?</p>

        <h5 class="name charGoring">LORD GORING.</h5>  
        <p class="speech">Good heavens!  No.  What does it say?</p>

        <h5 class="name charCaversham">LORD CAVERSHAM.</h5>  
        <p class="speech">What should it say, sir?  Everything complimentary, of course.  
            Chiltern’s speech last night on this Argentine Canal scheme was one of the finest 
            pieces of oratory ever delivered in the House since Canning.</p>
